    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA with a persistent sidebar for navigation between key sections: Dashboard, Roadmap, Topic Deep Dive, Company Insights, and an interactive Practice Zone. This non-linear structure empowers users to explore content based on their immediate needs (e.g., finding questions for a specific topic) rather than following the report's linear flow, enhancing usability and engagement. The Practice Zone with filtering/searching is the core interactive feature, turning a static list of questions into a dynamic study tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: DSA Topic Priorities -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Static visual reference on Dashboard -> Justification: Provides a quick, scannable overview of which topics are most important to focus on. Report Info: 400+ Practice Questions -> Goal: Organize/Explore -> Presentation: Interactive HTML Table -> Interaction: JS-powered filtering by topic/difficulty and live search -> Justification: Transforms a static, overwhelming list into a powerful, user-driven study tool, which is the primary value-add of this SPA. Report Info: 4-Phase Roadmap -> Goal: Inform/Change -> Presentation: HTML/CSS Accordion/Timeline -> Interaction: Clicking a phase reveals its content -> Justification: Organizes the time-based plan logically without cluttering the UI. CONFIRMATION: NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
